# the `a11yhood` static site assets.

the `a11yhood` uses repositories for concepts that contain code, documentation, 
and web assets. we use each of the repos as namespaces for web content and demos.
this repository is used to keep consistent jekyll themes across the assets.

```
gh repo clone a11yhood/site-settings
pip install site-settings
python -m site_settings
rm -rf site-settings
```
